# README #

This project is an effort to document vulnerabilities that can occur in Android apps running on Android 7.1 - Android 4.2. It contains examples of benign apps with vulnerabilities related to *ICC, Storage, Web and System APIs*. Where possible, it also contains malicious apps to demonstrate corresponding exploits. We have grouped the vulnerabilities based on the sort of capabilities that lead to them.  In each group, each vulnerability sample occurs in folder named X_Y where X is the capability that leads to the vulnerability and Y is the enabled exploit.
