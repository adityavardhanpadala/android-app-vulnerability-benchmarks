#Description of the vulnerability and corresponding exploit
Content Providers in Android provide an interface to components through which they can interact with the underlying data store. Components running in the same process as that of the content provider have unlimited access to its methods. If a content provider is *exported* then components running in processes other than its own also have unlimited access to its methods. However, a content provider can limit access to components running in processes other than its own via permissions.
For example, the *AndroidManifest.xml* file in *ExploitContentProvider2/benign/app/src/main* defines a content provider called *UserDetailsContentProvider* in the <provider> tag. This content provider is protected with a read permission i.e. components running in other processes need to ask the user for this permission to read from the content provider. It is protected with an additional read permission on the path */user* as specified in the *<path-permission>* tag, which means that among the components running in processes other than the content provider's, only those that belong to the same developer can be granted this permission. All other requests will be disallowed by the system.
The vulnerability exists because */user/ssn* contains sensitive information. The developer protected */user* and mistakenly assumed that this would protect */user* and all paths under */user* includind */user/ssn*. However, the assumption is incorrect. The sample malicious app (in the folder *Malicious*) with read permission to the content provider, is able to query the content provider and retrieve sensitive information in */user/ssn*.
