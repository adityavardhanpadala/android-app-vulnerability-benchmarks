# Description of the vulnerability and the corresponding vulnerability.
Consider a benign app that helps a user manage her files. This app has a content provider that provides an 
interface to its Database. The Database saves all files created, edited and uploaded by the user. The app also works
offline i.e. when the deivce is not connected to the internet, it saves the files locally in its internal storage and 
uploads the files to the database when the device is connected to the internet. Unfortunately the interface to save files
to local internal storage is vulnerable. A malicious app can invoke it and inject malicious files into the internal file-
system. When the device comes back online, the app data is sync-ed with the database. Any malicious files in the internal
file-system also gets uploaded. Since, the benign content provider allows other apps to read from the database. A malicious
app can read the injected files from the database and execute it in its own context.
