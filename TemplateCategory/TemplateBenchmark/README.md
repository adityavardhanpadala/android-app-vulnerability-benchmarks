# Description of vulnerability and corresponding exploit
Provide the context for the vulnerability captured by the benchmark.  Specifically, describe the features, APIs, and workflow that lead to the creation of the vulnerability.

*Issue:*  In terms of the above featues, describe the vulnerability and how it is created.

*Example:*  Describe how the vulnerability is demonstrated by the apps in the benchmark. 


# Steps to build the sample apps and to exploit the vulnerability

Provide instructions to use the apps to demonstrate the vulnerability

1. list targets:

    `$ android list targets`

2. List available Android Virtual Devices:

    `$ android list avd`

3. Create an emulator:

    `$ android create avd -n <name> -t <target>`

    *<target>* is obtained from the command listed in 1. *<name>* is the name you choose to give to the avd.

4. Start emulator:

    `$ emulator -avd <avd_name>`

    *<avd-name>* is obtained from the command listed in 2.

5. Build and install *Benign*:

    `$ cd Benign`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

6. Build and install *Malicious*:

    `$ cd Malicious`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

7. Launch *Malicious* in the emulator where it is installed. 

    An activity should display “Activity started from service.” message.
