# Summary
Apps that store the encryption key in the source code are vulnerable to leaking encrypted information.

# Versions of Android affected
Tested on Android 4.4 - Android 7.1

# Description of the vulnerability and the corresponding exploit
Android apps can use block cipher algorithms to encrypt sensitive information using the *Cipher* API.

*Issue:* The *Cipher* API expects a key. If the key being used for encryption/decryption is saved in the source code then an attacker can get access to it.

*Example:* This vulnerability is demonstrated by the pair of apps *Benign* and *Malicious*. *Benign* has a reset password feature which allows registered users to change their password. A registered user needs to provide her email id to reset her password. *Benign* takes this email id, encrypts it using *AES* in *ECB* mode and sends it as a token to the email id. The user can then key in this token. When *Benign* receives this token, it decrypts it and verifies whether the email is a registered one. If it is then the user is allowed to reset her password else she is not allowed to reset password. Let us assume that the attacker wants to reset the password of a certain email id - *anniemaes@gmail.com*. To do this, the attacker needs to know the token of *anniemaes@gmail.com*. The attacker already knows the key so she can create bogus email ids and infer the IV. The attacker can now encrypt *anniemaes@gmail.com* with the known key and the inferred IV to get the token. The generated token is used by *Malicious* to load *Benign/ResetPasswordActivity.java*. The attacker can then reset the password of *anniemaes@gmail.com*.


# Steps to build the sample apps and to exploit the vulnerability

1. List targets:

    `$ android list targets`

2. List available Android Virtual Devices:

    `$ android list avd`

3. Create an emulator:

    `$ android create avd -n <name> -t <target>`

    *target* is obtained from the command listed in 1. *name* is the name you choose to give to the avd.

4. Start emulator:

    `$ emulator -avd <avd_name>`

    *avd-name* is obtained from the command listed in 2.

5. Build and install Benign:

    `$ cd Benign`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

6. Build and install Malicious:

    `$ cd Malicious`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

7.  Open *Benign* in the emulator where you installed the app.

8.  Open *Malicious* in the emulator where you installed the app.

9.  In *Malicious* click *Reset Password* button. You should be able to see the *Reset Password* for *anniemaes@gmail.com* in *Benign*.
