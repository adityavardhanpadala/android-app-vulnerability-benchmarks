1. **BlockCipher-ECB-InformationExposure-Lean**
Apps that use a block cipher algorithm in ECB mode for encrypting sensitive information are vulnerable to leaking sensitive information.

2. **BlockCipher-NonandomIV-InformationExposure-Lean**
Apps that use a block cipher algorithm in CBC mode  with a non random Initialization Vector to encrypt sensitive information are vulnerable to leaking sensitive information.
