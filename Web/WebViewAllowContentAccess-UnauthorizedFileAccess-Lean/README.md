# Summary
Apps can allow execution of Javascript code inside WebView without verifying the source of JavaScript can unintentionally expose content provided via content providers.

# Android versions affected
Tested on Android 5.1.1 - Android 8.1

# Description of vulnerability and corresponding exploit
An Android app can display web pages by loading HTML/JavaScript files in a *WebView*. The loaded
HTML/JavaScript file runs in the context of the app i.e. it has access to the same resources and has the
same permissions the app has. For example, an HTML file loaded into the app from a server will have access
to the app's internal file system because the HTML file loaded from the server runs in the context of
the app.


*Issue:* An attacker can inject and execute malicious JavaScript inside a WebView instance that allows JavaScript execution. If the WebView instance has permission to access and perform privileged operations on the app's *content provider*, then the malicious JavaScript will also have similar permissions.
If the WebView has permission to the the app's *content provider* to perform privileged operations then the malicious JavaScript
inside the WebView, will also have the same ability.

*Example:* The vulnerability is demonstrated by *Benign*. The
*MainActivity* of this app has a WebView instance that loads an HTML file from an internal file system.
The WebView uses *WebSettings.setJavaScriptEnable(true)* to enable JavaScript to execute in its context and uses *WebSettings.setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs(true)*
to enable URLs with content scheme to access data provided by app's *content provider*. Note that this is secure because the web page is loaded from a file in the
internal file-system. However, the web page contains JavaScript code that gets loaded into the WebView when the file URL is loaded.
JavaScript code will be executed in the context of the HTML file.
Due to *WebSettings.setJavaScriptEnable(true)*, *WebSettings.setAllowUniversalAccessFromFileURLs(true)*, and *WebSettings.setAllowContentAccess(true)*, JavaScript code will be able to access data provided by the app's *content provider.* *Misc/LocalServer* acts as man-in-the-middle that injects *Misc/LocalServer/templates/contentAccess.js* into the WebView. When the *uploadFile()* method in *contentAccess.js* executes, it reads sensitive data from the file which can be accessed by *content provider*.

Note: For WebView to access of the appâ€™s content provider, *WebSettings.setAllowContentAccess(true)* needs to be true and it is true by default.


# Steps to build the sample apps and to exploit the vulnerability

1. Setup a local Web Server. We have used Flask here. If you want to use Flask follow the instructions [here](https://bitbucket.org/secure-it-i/android-app-vulnerability-benchmarks/src/76cc87180f064b328c37cc57b5c743dba378a5de/Misc/LocalServer/README.md?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default).

2. List targets:

    `$ avdmanager list targets`

3. List available Android Virtual Devices:

    `$ avdmanager list avd`

4. Create an emulator:

    `$ avdmanager create avd -n <name> -k <target>`

    *<target>* is obtained from the command listed in 1. *<name>* is the name you choose to give to the avd.

5. Start emulator:

    `$ emulator -avd <avd_name>`

    *<avd-name>* is obtained from the command listed in 3.


6. Make sure *demo1.html* has the correct URL to the JavaScript file if you are not using local web server of your machine.


7. Build and install *Benign*:

    `$ cd Benign`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installApi[VERSION]Debug`

8. Save *demo1.html* and *File2* in the app's internal file system:

        `$ adb root`

        `$ adb push demo1.html /data/data/edu.ksu.cs.benign/files/demo1.html`

        `$ adb push File2 /data/data/edu.ksu.cs.benign/files/File2`


9. Launch *Benign*.

    The WebView should display the contents of *File2* thus demonstrating that *fileAccess.js* has access to the internal file-system of the app.
