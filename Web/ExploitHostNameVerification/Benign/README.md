# Summary
Apps that do not check for the validity of a host name when communicating with a server are 
vulnerable to MITM attacks.   

# Android versions affected
Tested on Android 4.2 - Android 7.1

# Description of vulnerability and corresponding exploit
Android apps can use SSL/TLS to securely communicate with a web server. This involves two things. First,
check whether the web server is signed by a Certficate Authority that is trusted by the client, in this case
the app. Second, once the validity of the Certficate Authority has been established, verify whether the
certificate presented by the server is correct. If it is not then the connection will be refused. Verification
of the certificate can fail due two reaons. One, if the certificate presented by the server does not 
have the correct hostname in its subject line. Second, due to virtual hosting, the server returns an incorrect
certificate to the client.


*Issue:* Android allows apps to override the default *HostnameVerifier* and implement their own HostnameVerifier.
The *verify* method in *HostnameVerifier* can be used to explicitly check for a host name that the app expects
and returns a boolean. But if the method is incorrectly implemented then the app can end up connecting
to a malicious server.

*Example:* An example of such a vulnerability is shown in *ExploitHostNameVerification/Benign*. The app
connects to a server over TLS that produces a certificate that is incorrect. The implements in its own
*HostnameVerifier.verify()* method and returns true all the time. This means that the app can connect to
a server with any host name. A malicious server can easily connect to the app due to this vulnerability.
