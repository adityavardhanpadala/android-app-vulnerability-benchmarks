# Summary
Apps that do not validate request URLs before loading them into a WebView are vulnerable to loading
malicious web content.

# Android versions affected
Tested on Android 4.4 - Android 7.1

# Description of vulnerability and corresponding exploit

Android allows apps to load resources (e.g, JavaScript, CSS files etc.) in a web page in a WebView, and control the resources being loaded in a webpage via the *shouldInterceptRequest()* method in *WebViewClient*. 
The *shouldInterceptRequest()* method takes an instance of WebView and the resource request as input and returns a response object. If the response object returned
is null then the WebView is loaded with the web page containing the resource that was requested. But if a non-null response is returned then the WebView is loaded with the web page
containing the nin-null response.

*Issue:* the app does not validate the resource in shouldInterceptRequest method of WebViewClient. Consequently, any resource can be loaded into WebView.

*Example:* The vulnerability is demonstrated by *Benign*. The *MainActivity* of this app has a WebView which loads a *http* URL provided by the user of the 
app which means that the URL can be anything. The app contains *MyWebViewClient* which extends the default *WebViewClient* and
overrides the *shouldInterceptRequest()* method. The method just returns null which means that any resource including malicious resources can be loaded into the WebView. 
Since, the WebView loads content from a *http* url, it is possible for a man in the middle to embed a malicious resource into it. 
When the user interacts with the web page containing the malicious resource, for example she clicks on a button that triggers a request to a malicious server, 
then the malicious server will send a response and that response will be loaded into the WebView in the absence of sanity checks for resources 
in the *shouldInterceptRequest()* method.


# Steps to build the sample apps and to exploit the vulnerability

1. Setup a local Web Server. We have used Flask here. If you want to use Flask follow the instructions [here](https://bitbucket.org/secure-it-i/android-vulnerabilities-benchmark/src/d932b692a7c5697d8b688e643d76b78e53126a60/LocalServer/README.md?at=master&fileviewer=file-view-default).

2. List targets:

    `$ android list targets`

3. List available Android Virtual Devices:

    `$ android list avd`

4. Create an emulator:

    `$ android create avd -n <name> -t <target>`

    *<target>* is obtained from the command listed in 1. *<name>* is the name you choose to give to the avd.

5. Start emulator:

    `$ emulator -avd <avd_name>`

    *<avd-name>* is obtained from the command listed in 3.

6. Edit the *url* field in *Benign/.../res/values/strings.xml* to reflect the url of the web server where the html file being loaded is stored.

7. Build and install *Benign*:

    `$ cd Benign`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

8. Set up Man-in-The-Middle and embed malicious code to invoke the *getKey()* method.
