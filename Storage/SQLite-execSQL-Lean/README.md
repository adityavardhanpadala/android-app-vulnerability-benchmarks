# Summary
Apps that use *SQLiteDatabase.execSQL()* method to construct non-parameterized SQL queries are vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

# Versions of Android affected
Tested on Android 4.4 - 7.1

# Description of the vulnerability and the corresponding exploit
Android allows apps to save data in a local database called SQLlite. SQL queries are used to interact with the SQLlite database. *execSQL()* method of SQLlite allows developer to execute queries such as INSERT/DELETE/UPDATE which does not return any result.

*Issue:*  If an app uses inputs (e.g., user input via UI or data from web) to create a SQL statement to be executed via *execSQL()* method, then the app may be vulnerable to *SQL-injection attack*.

*Example:* This benchmark demonstrates this vulnerability by using two apps: *Benign* and *Malicious*. *Benign* app takes an input from another app to update the value of a given key. *MiddleActivity* in *Benign* app uses this input as (without sanitizing it) to construct a SQL statement that is executed via *execSQL()*. *Malicious* app exploits this behavior of *Benign* app by providing the value *"666 where clause 1=1"* to change the value of all keys in the target table to 666.

Note: To make sure our tests are consistent, we introduced *Truncate Table* button. It will clear all entries from the table and *Insert Data* button will add two entries in the table. So, we are always starting with empty table and then adding two entries. 

# Steps to build the sample apps and to exploit the vulnerability

1. List targets:

    `$ android list targets`

2. List available Android Virtual Devices:

    `$ android list avd`

3. Create an emulator:

    `$ android create avd -n <name> -t <target>`

    *<target>* is obtained from the command listed in 1. *<name>* is the name you choose to give to the avd.

4. Start emulator:

    `$ emulator -avd <avd_name>`

    *<avd-name>* is obtained from the command listed in 2.

5. Build and install *Benign*:

    `$ cd Benign`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

6. Launch *Benign* and click *Truncate Table* and then *Insert Data* button.   

7. Build and install *Malicious*:

    `$ cd Malicious`

    Make sure there is a file called local.properties with an entry sdk=/path/to/Android/sdk.

    `$ ./gradlew installDebug`

8.  Launch *Malicious* and click on *Data Injection* button.

    It will start *Benign's Middle Activity*. You will see updated pairs of *key/value* displayed on the screen.

9. Click back button.

    You will see *Malicious* activity with textview set to *Success*.

10. Check in log for all the *key/value pairs*

    `$ adb logcat -d | grep "Malicious"`
